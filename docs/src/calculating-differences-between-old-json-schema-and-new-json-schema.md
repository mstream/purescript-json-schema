# Calculating differences between old JSON schema and new JSON schema

Calculating JSON Schema Difference is a process used to identify the changes between two JSON schemata.\
It is used to to see what has been added, removed, or changed.\
This is useful for tracking changes over time, understanding the impact of changes, and managing versions of a schema.\
It can also be used to generate a diff report or to automate the process of updating dependent systems or documentation when a schema changes.

## Properties

- comparing identical schemata yields no differences

### calculating differences between JSON schema accepting only number less than or equal to some number and JSON schema accepting only number less than or equal to other number

Any change of maximum inclusive keyword value should be considered a difference.

_Input:_

JSON schema accepting only number less than or equal to other number:

> ```json
> {
>   "maximum": 4
> }
> ```

JSON schema accepting only number less than or equal to some number:

> ```json
> {
>   "maximum": 2
> }
> ```

_Output:_

a change in inclusive maximum value:

> - JSON schema path: #/maximum
>
>   change of maximum from 2.0 to 4.0

### calculating differences between JSON schema accepting only number greater than or equal to some number and JSON schema accepting only number greater than or equal to other number

Any change of minimum inclusive keyword value should be considered a difference.

_Input:_

JSON schema accepting only number greater than or equal to other number:

> ```json
> {
>   "minimum": 4
> }
> ```

JSON schema accepting only number greater than or equal to some number:

> ```json
> {
>   "minimum": 2
> }
> ```

_Output:_

a change in inclusive minimum value:

> - JSON schema path: #/minimum
>
>   change of minimum from 2.0 to 4.0

---

### calculating differences between JSON schema accepting only multiples of a some number and JSON schema accepting only multiples of other number

Any change of multipleOf keyword should be considered a difference.

_Input:_

JSON schema accepting only multiples of other number:

> ```json
> {
>   "multipleOf": 4
> }
> ```

JSON schema accepting only multiples of a some number:

> ```json
> {
>   "multipleOf": 2
> }
> ```

_Output:_

a change in accepted value factor:

> - JSON schema path: #/multipleOf
>
>   change of multipleOf from 2.0 to

### calculating differences between JSON schema accepting only number greater than some number and JSON schema accepting only number greater than other number

Any change of minimum exclusive keyword value should be considered a difference.

_Input:_

JSON schema accepting only number greater than other number:

> ```json
> {
>   "exclusiveMinimum": 4
> }
> ```

JSON schema accepting only number greater than some number:

> ```json
> {
>   "exclusiveMinimum": 2
> }
> ```

_Output:_

a change in exclusive minimum value:

> - JSON schema path: #/exclusiveMinimum
>
>   change of exclusiveMinimum from 2.0 to 4.0

---

### calculating differences between JSON schema accepting only some type and JSON schema accepting only other type

Any change in expected JSON value type should be considered a difference.

_Input:_

JSON schema accepting only other type:

> ```json
> {
>   "type": [
>     "boolean"
>   ]
> }
> ```

JSON schema accepting only some type:

> ```json
> {
>   "type": [
>     "null"
>   ]
> }
> ```

_Output:_

a change in accepted value type:

> - JSON schema path: #/type
>
>   change of accepted JSON value types from
>
>   - null
>
>   to
>
>   - boolean

### calculating differences between JSON schema accepting only number less than some number and JSON schema accepting only number less than other number

Any change of maximum exclusive keyword value should be considered a difference.

_Input:_

JSON schema accepting only number less than other number:

> ```json
> {
>   "exclusiveMaximum": 4
> }
> ```

JSON schema accepting only number less than some number:

> ```json
> {
>   "exclusiveMaximum": 2
> }
> ```

_Output:_

a change in exclusive maximum value:

> - JSON schema path: #/exclusiveMaximum
>
>   change of exclusiveMaximum from 2.0 to 4.0

---

### calculating differences between same schema and some schema

comparing two identical schemata yields no differences

_Input:_

some schema:

> ```json
> false
> ```

same schema:

> ```json
> false
> ```

_Output:_

no differences:
